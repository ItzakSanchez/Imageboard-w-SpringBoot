# Imageboard-w-SpringBoot

## Descrpition
Welcome to **Digital World**, an imageboard created to share anonymously with other users on various topics. This project started with the purpose of improving my skills in Spring boot, in each iteration this project slowly became an interesting tool that could create digital communities. An image board is a type of online forum where users post images, often along with text and discussion. The first image boards were created in Japan and were based on the textboard concept.
